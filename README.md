# Handwriting-Recognition
A Python project for Handwriting Recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built and trained in Google Colab. This project uses MNIST dataset with custom labels. A neural network maps digits (0â€“9) to new labels, trains on images, and visualizes accuracy, loss, and prediction results effectively.
